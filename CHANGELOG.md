# Changelog

Format: [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Version headings match `manifest.json`'s `version`.

## 1.0.1

### Fixed

- No bubbles appeared anywhere. The mod decorated `OverworldState:draw`,
  but that is `beginWorldPass / drawWorld / endWorldPass / drawUI` — so the
  bubbles were drawn after the world pass had already ended, outside the
  space `npc.px - cam.x` is measured in. They now go inside `drawWorld`,
  where the engine draws its own sighting bubble.
- Placement matches the engine exactly: `+4` across and `-14` up from the
  sprite's origin, the same offsets `fxEmote` uses, so a mod bubble sits at
  the same height as a trainer's.

## 1.0.0

### Added

- A bubble over NPCs whose conversation would actually do something:
  `!` for a gift, `?` for a world change, the smile for story dialogue.
- `GIFT BUBBLE`, `EVENT BUBBLE` and `STORY BUBBLE` toggles, all on.
